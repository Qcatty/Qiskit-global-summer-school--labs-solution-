## lab-1
in this lab you will learn:

### Part I: Introduction to Qiskit
#### I.1: Basic Rotations on One Qubit and Measurements on the Bloch Sphere
##### 1.) Let us start easy by performing a bit flip. The goal is to reach the state |1> 
##### 2.) Next, we would like to create superposition. The goal is to reach the state |+> = 1/sqrt(2)(|0>+|1>)
##### 3.) Let's combine those two. The goal is to reach the state .|-> = 1/sqrt(2)(|0>-|1>) 
##### 4.) Finally, we move on to the complex numbers. The goal is to reach the state |-i> = 1/sqrt(2)(|0>-i|1>) .
#### I.2: Quantum Circuits Using Multi-Qubit Gates
##### 5.) Construct the Bell state 
##### 6.) Write a function that builds a quantum circuit on 3 qubits and creates the GHZ-like state.
### Part II: Oracles and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm
#### II.1: Deutsch-Jozsa Problem
#### II.2: Quantum Solution to the Deutsch-Josza Problem


## Lab=2: Introduction to Variational Algorithms
#### In this Lab, you will learn about
- variational quantum algorithms, in particular Variational Quantum Eigensolvers
- how to create and work with parameterized circuits and quadratic programs in Qiskit
- how to solve optimization problems using QAOA


## Lab-3: Quantum Kernels and Support Vector Machines

In this lab, you will learn how to implement quantum feature maps, quantum kernels and quantum support vector classification in Qiskit. 


## lab-4: Training Parameterized Quantum Circuits

In this lab session we will have a closer look on how to train circuit-based models. At the end of this session you should know

how to build variational quantum classifiers
how to use different training techniques, especially gradient-based
what restrictions the variational-based models have and how we might overcome them
### Where do we need to train parameterized circuits?
